# STEP 2: WRANGLE DATA AND COMBINE INTO A SINGLE FILE
#====================================================
# Compare column names of each of the files to ensure they match perfectly before combining them into one file.

#======================================================
# STEP 3: CLEAN UP AND ADD DATA TO PREPARE FOR ANALYSIS
#======================================================
# Inspect the new table that has been created
# List the column names
colnames(all_trips)
# Determine the number of rows in the data frame
nrow(all_trips)
# Determine the dimensions of the data frame
dim(all_trips)
# View the first 6 rows of the data frame
head(all_trips)  # Also tail(all_trips)
# See the list of columns and types
str(all_trips)
# Statistical summary of the data, mainly for numerics
summary(all_trips)

# We shall fix the following issues:
# (1) In the "member_casual" column, there are two names for members ("member" and "Subscriber") and two names for casual riders ("Customer" and "casual"). We will need to consolidate that from four to two labels.
# (2) The data can only be aggregated at the ride-level, which is too granular. We will want to add some additional columns of data -- such as day, month, year -- that provide additional opportunities to aggregate the data.
# (3) We will want to add a calculated field for length of ride since the 2020Q1 data did not have the "tripduration" column. We will add "ride_length" to the entire dataframe for consistency.
# (4) There are some rides where tripduration shows up as negative, including several hundred rides where Divvy took bikes out of circulation for Quality Control reasons. We will want to delete these rides.


# In the "member_casual" column, replace "Subscriber" with "member" and "Customer" with "casual"
## Before 2020, Divvy used different labels for these two types of riders ... we will want to make our dataframe consistent with their current nomenclature

# Begin by seeing the number of observations that fall under each usertype
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Reassign to the desired values (we will go with the current 2020 labels)
all_trips <-  all_trips %>%

                                ,"Customer" = "casual"))

# Check to make sure the proper number of observations were reassigned
table(all_trips$member_casual)

# Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
# This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level

all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
