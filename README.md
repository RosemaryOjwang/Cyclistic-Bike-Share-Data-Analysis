# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Data-Analysis



## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study! In this case study, the task is to explore historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. The company aims to increase the number of annual memberships, as they are more profitable than casual rides. The marketing team seeks to identify trends and behaviors that can inform a strategy to convert casual riders—who currently use single-ride or full-day passes—into annual members. This analysis will uncover key insights into rider behavior and provide data-backed recommendations to shape future marketing campaigns, ultimately answering the question: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
